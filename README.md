# hello-hammy
Here is a list of annoying things I need to ask Hammy. 

Do I put the dataset I want to query in a folder in here? 
How does the @mention system work? 
Oh, and I'm writing this note up on my PC, with Python 3.5. Do I need anything more? Notepad is fine?
**UPDATE, MARCH 24, 2018: I have a MacBook pro with Python 3.x and a whole bunch of other stuff besides.**
I still have the other questions.
